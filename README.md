Project Overview
This project simulates a self-driving car using JavaScript without any external libraries. It covers car driving mechanics, road definition, sensors for detecting obstacles, and a neural network for controlling the car's movements. The car learns to navigate through traffic and avoid collisions using artificial intelligence, making it a fun and interactive way to explore neural networks and machine learning principles.

Credits
This project is based on the Self-Driving Car with JavaScript Course by Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor, hosted on freeCodeCamp.org. The course walks through building a self-driving car simulation from scratch, covering key concepts like neural networks, car mechanics, environment setup, sensors, and collision detection.

Check out the full course on YouTube: Self-Driving Car with JavaScript Course.
